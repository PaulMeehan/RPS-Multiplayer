# Rock-Paper-Scissors

**Purpose:**
This application provides a digital version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  It is intended to be played by two players, each with the game open in separate windows.

**User instructions:**
Two players each open the game from their own computer.  The game will give you instructions in the middle of the display

Sign into the game by entering your name and clicking the Submit button.  Once two players have signed in, the game will begin.

For each round, each play selects a choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors.  The object of the game is to select the choice that beats the other players choice.  But choose wisely!  Each choice is capable of beating another choice, but will also be beaten by one other choice.  The ranking goes as follows:

* Paper beats Rock
* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper

After each player has made a choice, the winner will be displayed and the scores will be updated.  There is no limit to the number of rounds you can play.

If you leave the game and come back later, your scores will pick up right where you left off.

You can start a whole new game by clicking the New Game button.


**Technical information:**
The application makes use of a Firebase database.  This database is available to the public without user authentication.
